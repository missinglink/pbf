utilities for parsing OpenStreetMap PBF files and extracting geographic data

### installation

> tested on go version go1.9, recommended go1.10, cross-compilation possibly broken in recent versions of go

```bash
$ go get github.com/missinglink/pbf
```

### disclaimer

this repo contains a bunch of experiments including a monkey-patched parsing library, it should be considered as permanently in development.

please feel free to fork and contribute, at some stage it might reach a level of maturity and stability where it could be published as a more general-purpose tool.

### get more detailed information on a specific command

```bash
$ pbf help stats

NAME:
   pbf stats - pbf statistics

USAGE:
   pbf stats [command options] [arguments...]

OPTIONS:
   --interval value, -i value  write stats every i milliseconds (default: 0)
```

### running the tests

```bash
$ go test $(go list ./... | grep -v /vendor/)
```

### docker

#### build the docker image

> this image is currently ~700MB, I would be happy to receive a PR which reduced the on-disk image size.

```bash
$ docker build -t missinglink/pbf .
```

#### run a container

there are many options for `docker run` which are out-of-scope for this document. if you are new to docker, have a read over the docs for the options specified below and also the `-v` flag which specifies how you can share directories/files between the container and your host OS.

```bash
$ docker run --rm -it missinglink/pbf ./pbf
```

### issues / bugs

please open a github issue / open a pull request.

if you are planning a non-trivial feature, please open an issue to discuss it first.
